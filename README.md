## 💡 Business Recommendations & Projected Impact

1. **Inventory** → Prioritize Clothing & Outerwear stock for Winter (Maroon, Gray, Size L) and Spring (Violet, Size M)  
2. **Marketing** → Use selective discounting on Loyal High-Spenders only (current 43% discount usage is healthy, avoid blanket 100%)  
3. **Loyalty** → Aggressively convert first-time buyers to subscribers (target: 50% penetration)
4. **Geographic** Expansion → Double ad spend in California, New York, Texas, Florida
5. **Operations** → Bundle premium shipping (2-Day/Express) with targeted offers for high-AOV segments
6. **Advanced Analytics** → Deploy Random Forest model for personalized discount recommendations and dynamic pricing

**Projected Financial Impact: +15–22% revenue** (**$35,000–$51,300** additional) within 12 months
